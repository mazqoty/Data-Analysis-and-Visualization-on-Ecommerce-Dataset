# Pakistan_Largest_Ecommerce_Dataset
This is the largest retail e-commerce orders dataset from Pakistan. It contains half a million transaction records from March 2016 to August 2018. The data was collected from various e-commerce merchants as part of a research study. I am releasing this dataset as a capstone project for my data science course at Alnafi (alnafi.com/zusmani).
There is a dire need for such dataset to learn about Pakistanâ€™s emerging e-commerce potential and I hope this will help many startups in many ways.
